+# 01-doc - checks for errors and warnings and there are warnings due to obsolted keywords

+# root_anchor - This fails because the pem file has been updated and re are shipping an

+#
+# root_hints - This fails because addresses of root servers changed and we are shipping
+# an old copy of it. This is not an issue as all servers usually do priming on startup
+#
